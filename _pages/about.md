I am a second year PhD student of Computing Science, Arizona State University. I work as a research assistant at [Data Mining and Machine Learning (DMML)](https://dmml.asu.edu/) Laboratory, advised by Professor [Huan Liu](https://www.public.asu.edu/~huanliu/). Before that, I obtained my master and bachelor degrees from [Korea University](https://www.korea.edu/mbshome/mbs/en/index.do).
