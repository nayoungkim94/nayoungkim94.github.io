# üë©‚Äçüíª About Me
Nayoung Kim is a fourth-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at the [School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence (SCAI)](https://scai.engineering.asu.edu/) at Arizona State University, specializing in advancing trustworthiness and truthfulness in AI to develop fair, robust, and accurate NLP/LLM systems. Her recent research focuses on enhancing fairness and robustness in GenAI algorithms, particularly in the context of large language models in social media mining. Currently, she works full-time as a research assistant at [DHS-CAOE](https://caoe.asu.edu/) and Data Mining and Machine Learning (DMML) Laboratory, under the mentorship of [Dr. Huan Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Dzf46C8AAAAJ) and [Dr. Mickey Mancenido](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=f_0QDJUAAAAJ&hl=en). Before joining DMML lab, she obtained CSE bachelor's and master's degrees from [Korea University](https://www.korea.edu/mbshome/mbs/en/index.do) advised by [Dr. Jaewoo Kang](https://dmis.korea.ac.kr/home).

Her resume is available [here](../files/NayoungKim_Resume_2024.pdf).
