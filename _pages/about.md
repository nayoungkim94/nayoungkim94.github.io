# üë©‚Äçüíª About Me
I am a third-year Ph.D. student at the [School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence (SCAI)](https://scai.engineering.asu.edu/), Arizona State University, specializing in Trustworthy AI. My research focuses on fairness and robustness in AI/ML, particularly in domain generalization and bias mitigation for LM-based NLP tasks, such as stance detection or hate speech detection. I am currently a research assistant at DHS-CAOE and Data Mining and Machine Learning (DMML) Laboratory, under the guidance of [Dr. Huan Liu](https://www.public.asu.edu/~huanliu/) and [Dr. Mickey Mancenido](https://www.mickeymancenido.com/). Before joining DMML, I obtained my bachelor and master degree from [Korea University](https://www.korea.edu/mbshome/mbs/en/index.do) advised by [Dr. Jaewoo Kang](https://dmis.korea.ac.kr/home).\
