I am a second year PhD student of Computing Science, Arizona State University. I work as a research assistant at [Data Mining and Machine Learning (DMML)](https://dmml.asu.edu/) Laboratory, advised by Professor [Huan Liu](https://www.public.asu.edu/~huanliu/). Before that, I obtained my master and bachelor degrees from [Korea University](https://www.korea.edu/mbshome/mbs/en/index.do).
My research interest generally lies in data mining and machine learning, especially in fairness and robustness in AI. Recently, I'm focusing on domain generalization and bias mitigation in various NLP systems.
You can view my CV [here]().
