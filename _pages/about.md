I am a second year PhD student in School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence (SCAI), Arizona State University. I work as a research assistant at [Data Mining and Machine Learning (DMML)](https://dmml.asu.edu/) Laboratory, advised by Professor [Huan Liu](https://www.public.asu.edu/~huanliu/). Before joining DMML, I obtained my bachelor degree from [Korea University](https://www.korea.edu/mbshome/mbs/en/index.do) and master degree from Korea University [Data Mining and Information Systems (DMIS) Lab](https://dmis.korea.ac.kr/home).
My research interest generally lies in data mining and machine learning, especially in fairness and robustness in AI. Recently, I'm focusing on domain generalization and bias mitigation in various NLP systems.
