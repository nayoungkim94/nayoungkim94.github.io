Ongoing
------
**Reasoning-Level Fairness in LLMs** &mdash; *Under submission*
* Built a reasoning-aware framework for bias identification and mitigation in LLMs, modeling reasoning as Q → {R} → A to analyze how stereotypes emerge during intermediate steps.
* Introduced the **Reasoning Bias Rate (RBR)** metric, the first measure quantifying unsupported demographic assumptions in reasoning traces (a complementary signal beyond answer-level bias).
* Hybrid mitigation: process supervision with counterfactual augmentation, fairness-aware RL rewards, and inference-time guided decoding with fairness verifiers (built on OpenR).
* Reduced bias scores by **>20%** on the BBQ benchmark while preserving accuracy within 1% across GPT-3.5-Turbo and LLaMA-2-13B baselines.

2025
------
**MASTOPIA: Transparency in LLM-Assisted Intelligence Analysis** 
* Built **MASTOPIA**, a multi-agent RAG system (supervisor → retriever → generator agents) powered by GPT-4 / GPT-3.5 that operationalizes Multisource AI Scorecard Table (MAST) tradecraft standards through prompt engineering.
* Designed and ran a 2³ factorial human-subject study (n = 304) varying LLM performance, MAST transparency, and task severity, with behavioral logging of verification activity.
* Found that high-transparency outputs **did not improve performance** and in marginal conditions decreased it &mdash; evidence of overreliance from information overload &mdash; motivating adaptive / on-demand transparency design.

**MEGAWATT: MAST for Evaluating Generative AI in Worker–Automation Team Tasks**
* Applied the MAST trust-assessment framework to evaluate baseline performance and inform appropriate adoption of GPT-4 for intelligence-analysis (I&A) tasks.
* Ran human-subject studies measuring whether off-the-shelf or improved outputs lead to appropriate use, including correct rejections.
* Improved response quality with prompt engineering and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for summarization, NER, and conversational tasks.
