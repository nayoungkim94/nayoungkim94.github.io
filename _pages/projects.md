# Selected Projects
======
* Towards Fair Language Modeling via Parameter-Efficient Methods by Machine Feedback 2024
  * Mitigation of social biases in large language models (i.e., T5, BERT, LLaMA 2) based toxicity detection and hate speech detection
  * Train LLM to learn fairness and mitigate bias using reinforcement learning (RL) and parameter-efficient tuning methods (i.e., LoRA, P-tuning)

* MEGAWATT: MAST for Evaluating Generative AI in Worker-Automation Team Tasks 2024
  * Apply MAST (AI trust assessment tool) to evaluate baseline performance, inform improvement, and appropriate adoption of OpenAI's GPT-4, to assist in intelligence and analysis (I&A) type tasks
  * Conduct human subject studies to assess whether off-the-shelf or improved outputs can lead to appropriate use, including correct rejections of model outputs
  * Improve quality of GPT-4 responses with prompt engineering and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for general conversation and various NLP tasks (e.g., text summarization, entity recognition)

* Automated Evaluation of Machine-generated Summaries using RLHF 2024
  * Trained a LLM-based classifier to evaluate a document-summary pair through multi-class classification and reinforcement learning with handcrafted human preferences dataset
  * Conducted expert evaluations on the output scores to validate the effectiveness of the proposed learning method

* PADTHAI-MM: A Principled Approach for Designing Trustworthy, Human-centered AI systems using the MAST Methodology 2023
  * Developed a novel AI design framework, addressing the challenge of designing trustworthy AI systems
  * Demonstrated the effectiveness of the framework through the development of the AI-enabled decision support system, with the framework positively impacting trust perceptions among users
  * Conducted association analysis between participants' ratings and trust-impacting information, providing a theoretical basis for the framework's effectiveness in enhancing AI system trustworthiness

* READIT: REporting Assistant for Defense and Intelligence Tasks 2022
  * Trained and developed a text summarization system for use in intelligence analysis, utilizing Transformer-based models
  * Implemented a user-friendly web interface for the text summarization system using NodeJS and the Google Cloud Platform, allowing analysts to easily access summarized reports, enhancing their workflow and productivity

* Facewise: An AI-based Face ID Verification System 2022
  * Engineered a robust and accurate face ID verification system, ensuring a reliable and efficient means of identity authentication in security screening scenarios
  * Implemented face matching algorithms with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and ResNet and fine-tuned model parameters to optimize the system's performance, thus enhancing the overall security and user experience

* Interpreting Text Classifiers with Counterfactual Explanation 2021
  * Completed as the final project for CSE 472 (Social Media Mining)
  * Implemented counterfactual models for a multi-layer neural network used in text classification

* Biomedical Entity Relation Extraction 2017
  * Extracted Biomedical entities and identify their relation existence
  * Utilized the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) dataset, which provides chemical-gene, chemical-disease, and gene-disease relation data collections through distant supervision due to the lack of training data
  * Implemented and trained a tree-RNN based model, SPINN, in conjunction with a word-character embedding model
